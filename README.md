# fimber 

Extensible logging for Dart and Flutter.

Package is based on famous Android logging library API - [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber), this is library for simplify logging for Flutter.
Using similar (as far as Dart lang allows) method API with same concepts for tree and planting logging tree.
Also check out `flutter_fimber` which extends `fimber` to platform specific output and logging style.

## Getting Started

To start add using it:
### Add `fimber` to `pubspec.yaml`

#### pre-nullsafety

```yaml
dependencies:
  fimber: ^0.6.5
  ```
- remember about import in file you plan to use Fimber

```dart
import 'package:fimber/fimber.dart';

```

### Initialize logging tree on start of your application

```dart

void main() {
  Fimber.plantTree(DebugTree());
  // app code here ...
  
  // DebugTree options for time elapsed
  // by default DebugTree will output timestamp of the VM/Flutter app
  // to enable elapsed time since planting the tree log
  Fimber.plantTree(DebugTree.elapsed());
  
}
 
```

### Start using it with static methods:

```dart
import 'fimber.dart';


void main() {
  var parameter = 343.0;
  // use directly
  Fimber.i("Test message $argument");
  Fimber.i("Extra error message", ex: Exception("Test thorwable"));
  
  // other log levels
  Fimber.d("DEBUG");
  Fimber.v("VERBOSE");
  Fimber.w("WARN");
  
  try {
    throw Exception("Exception thrown");
  } catch (e, stacktrace) {
    // providing `stacktrace` will better show where issue was thrown
    // if not provided will use log line location.
    Fimber.i("Error caught.", ex: e, stacktrace: stacktrace);
  }
}

```

This will log the value and grab a TAG from stacktrace - that is little costly and if more logs will be done per second.

### Colorize logs - `ColorizeStyle`

`useColors` property set to true will use default colors of the logos, you can change the mapping with in `colorizeMap` for `DebugTree` and `CustomFormatTree`
The `useColors` by default is disabled.

`ColorizeStyle` Aggregates list of `AnsiStyle` so you can combine styles together.

`AnsiStyle` is combination of [`AnsiColor`](lib/colorize.dart) and [`AnsiSelection`](lib/colorize.dart) values

Here is output of test output.

![Colorize Test Output](doc/colorize_fimber_test.PNG "Colorize Test Output")


### Create tagged version of Fimber 

And use its instance inside class, you can create logger for a dart file or for a class.

```dart
var logger = FimberLog("MY_TAG");

void main() {
  
  logger.d("Test message");
}

// or inside a class
class SomeBloc {
  var logger = FimberLog("SomeBloc");
  String fetchMessage() {
    logger.d("About to fetch some data.");
    //...
    var data = "load something";

    logger.d("Retrived data (len = ${data.length}");
    return data;
  }
}
```

### Use block function and pass method that uses logger.

Use this function to log multiple messages with same tag, allows optional return value.
Due to nature of auto-tag generation from stacktrace this block only does it once and create local FimberLog instance to pass into the anonymous method.

```dart
    var someMessage = "Test message from inside of block";
    var output = Fimber.block((log) {
      log.d("Started block");
      var i = 0;
      for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        log.d("$someMessage, value: $i");
      }
      log.i("End of block");
      return i;
    });
```
### Custon line formatters

Use custom line formatters to define your logging format.

```dart

    Fimber.plantTree(CustomFormatTree(
        logFormat: "${CustomFormatTree.TIME_ELAPSED_TOKEN} ${CustomFormatTree
            .MESSAGE_TOKEN} ${CustomFormatTree.TIME_STAMP_TOKEN}"
    ));
```


## **Deprecated** moved to [`fimber_io`](https://pub.dev/packages/fimber_io/) package


```dart
import 'package:fimber_io/fimber_io.dart';

    Fimber.plantTree(FimberFileTree("my-Log-File.txt",
        logFormat: "${CustomFormatTree.TIME_ELAPSED_TOKEN} ${CustomFormatTree
            .MESSAGE_TOKEN} ${CustomFormatTree.TIME_STAMP_TOKEN}"
    ));
```

Use file log tree - the logs will go to a log file (Useful in DartVM apps).
There are log rolling with size and time/date interval, so it is possible to setup log output per hour/day or any other time.

see: `SizeRollingFileTree` or `TimedRollingFileTree` or use abstract class `RollingFileTree` to create your own version of rolling log file.


## TODO - road map

- See  [Issues on Github](https://github.com/magillus/flutter-fimber/issues)
- Add Crashlytics plugin (maybe other remote logger tools) with [flutter_crashlytics](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_crashlytics)
